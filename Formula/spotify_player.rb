# Homebrew formula for this fork, installing the release binaries built by
# .github/workflows/cd.yml. `version` and the checksums are rewritten on every
# tagged release by scripts/update-formula.py; everything else is hand-edited.
#
# The Linux binaries are built on GitHub's Ubuntu runners and link the system
# ALSA, D-Bus and OpenSSL libraries rather than Homebrew's.
